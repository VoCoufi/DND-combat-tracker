This roadmap contains feature suggestions generated by Claude Code based on D&D 5e combat mechanics and modern TUI application capabilities. These are independent ideas that complement the existing application.

**Organization:** Features are categorized by theme and marked with priority levels based on impact to DM workflow and implementation complexity.

**Priority Legend:**
- 🔴 **High**: Significant DM workflow improvement, frequently used
- 🟡 **Medium**: Quality of life enhancement, occasionally used
- 🟢 **Low**: Nice to have, edge cases or advanced scenarios

**Difficulty Scale:** Easy (< 1 day) | Medium (1-3 days) | Hard (3-7 days) | Very Hard (1-2 weeks)

## Combat Mechanics Enhancements

### 1. Legendary Actions Tracking
**Priority**: 🔴 High
**Difficulty**: Medium
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

**Description:**
Track legendary action points for boss monsters, including remaining points, available actions, and automatic reset on turn start.

**Use Case:**
Boss fights are central to D&D. DMs need to track 3 legendary action points that reset at the start of the creature's turn. Without tracking, it's easy to forget how many remain or use too many.

**Technical Approach:**
- Add `legendary_actions` field to Combatant (optional)
- Store max points, current points, and action descriptions
- Auto-reset on turn start
- UI indicator showing "LA: 2/3" next to boss HP
- Menu to spend legendary actions (deduct points)

**Implementation Notes:**
- Add to combatant creation flow (optional field)
- Display alongside reactions if creature has them
- Could share UI with reaction tracking

---

### 2. Damage Type Resistance/Immunity/Vulnerability
**Priority**: 🔴 High
**Difficulty**: Hard
**Estimated Effort**: 4-5 days

**Description:**
Track damage resistances, immunities, and vulnerabilities per combatant. Calculate damage automatically when dealing damage (halve for resistance, double for vulnerability, zero for immunity).

**Use Case:**
Many monsters have resistances (e.g., werewolf resistant to non-magical weapons). DMs must mentally calculate halved/doubled damage, which slows combat.

**Technical Approach:**
- Add `resistances`, `immunities`, `vulnerabilities` fields (Vec<DamageType>)
- Create `DamageType` enum: Slashing, Piercing, Bludgeoning, Fire, Cold, etc.
- When dealing damage, prompt for damage type
- Auto-calculate: resistance = damage/2, vulnerability = damage*2, immunity = 0
- Show modifier in damage confirmation: "8 fire damage → 4 (resistant)"

**Dependencies:**
- Damage type selection UI
- Math for damage calculation

---

### 3. Reactions Tracking
**Priority**: 🟡 Medium
**Difficulty**: Easy
**Estimated Effort**: 1 day

**Description:**
Track whether each combatant has used their reaction this round. Auto-reset at start of their turn.

**Use Case:**
Reactions (Shield spell, opportunity attacks) are limited to once per round. DMs forget who's used theirs.

**Technical Approach:**
- Add `has_reaction: bool` to Combatant (default true)
- Add command to mark reaction used
- Auto-reset on combatant's turn start
- UI indicator: "⚡" if available, grayed if used

---

### 4. Cover Mechanics Helper
**Priority**: 🟢 Low
**Difficulty**: Easy
**Estimated Effort**: 1 day

**Description:**
Quick reference for cover bonuses (+2 AC half cover, +5 AC three-quarters cover). Optionally apply to combatant AC temporarily.

**Use Case:**
DMs forget cover rules. Quick lookup saves time.

**Technical Approach:**
- Add to quick reference panel (already exists)
- Or: add "Apply Cover" action that temporarily modifies AC
- Show modifier in UI: "AC: 16 (+2 cover)"

---

### 5. Exhaustion Levels
**Priority**: 🟡 Medium
**Difficulty**: Easy
**Estimated Effort**: 1 day

**Description:**
Track exhaustion levels (1-6) with effects reminder for each level.

**Use Case:**
Exhaustion is common (forced marches, cold weather, monk stunning strike saves). Effects are complex and easy to forget.

**Technical Approach:**
- Add `exhaustion_level: u8` to Combatant (0-6)
- Show in UI: "Exh: 2" with effects on hover/reference
- Quick reference shows all 6 levels and effects

---

### 6. Advantage/Disadvantage Indicators
**Priority**: 🟡 Medium
**Difficulty**: Easy
**Estimated Effort**: 1 day

**Description:**
Mark combatants as having advantage or disadvantage on attacks/saves. Visual indicator only (DM still rolls manually).

**Use Case:**
Invisible, prone, paralyzed, etc. grant advantage/disadvantage. Visual reminder prevents forgetting.

**Technical Approach:**
- Add temporary status: "ADV on attacks", "DIS on DEX saves"
- Show with special icon/color in combatant list
- Clear manually or auto-clear on turn end

---

## Resource Management

### 7. Spell Slot Tracking
**Priority**: 🔴 High
**Difficulty**: Medium
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

**Description:**
Track spell slots per level (1st through 9th) for spellcaster combatants.

**Technical Approach:**
- Add `spell_slots: Option<SpellSlots>` to Combatant
- `SpellSlots` struct with `max` and `current` for each level (1-9)
- UI command to spend/regain slots
- Display: "Slots: 4/4 3/3 2/3 1/1" (levels 1-4)

---

### 8. Class Resource Tracking
**Priority**: 🟡 Medium
**Difficulty**: Medium
**Estimated Effort**: 2 days

**Description:**
